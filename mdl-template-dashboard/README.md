# Experimenting with CSS

* This is an attempt to figure out how to create some minimal HTML client side application that isn't painful to look at it
* Initial template is base [getmdl.io templates](https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html)

* You can start an http server to start using this tyemplate
* MDL stands for material design lite

```sh {"id":"01HXA6HD3MQZHG8JTSRD89T5AJ"}
python -m http.server 
```
