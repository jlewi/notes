title: "About Me"
---

I'm a Machine Learning platform engineer with over 15 years of experience. 
I'm an expert in using AI to solve practical business applications. 
I've built platforms for YouTube, Google Cloud Platform, and Primer to enable ML Engineers and data scientists to rapidly 
develop and deploy models into production. I played a pivotal role in developing systems like YouTube's Video Recommendations.
I also made major contributions to open-source software, including creating Kubeflow, one of the most popular OSS frameworks for ML.

I'm an expert in Cloud services, Kubernetes, MLOps, LLMOps, CICD, IAC, and GitOps. 

I'm currently developing an AI assistant, [Foyle](https://foyle.io) to simplify deploying and operating software.

I live in the Bay Area with my dog, Teddy. When I'm not working, I enjoy skiing, baking chocolate chip cookies, and hanging out with Teddy.
