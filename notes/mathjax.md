# Math in markdown

* It lookslike math can be rendered in markdown cells using a latext or mathml
* It can then be rendered using the JS library [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
* In vscode I was able to render it when it used `$$` as the delimeter 
* I was not able to render it when I included it in a code block using `math` as the language
  * THis does appear to render in [GitHub's markdown preview](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
