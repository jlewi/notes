# Distributed Tracing Experiment

Explore OpenTelemetry (OTEL) capabilities.

This minimalist application serves as a testbed for OTEL features.
It implements both gRPC and HTTP servers, enabling us to investigate:

* Automatic instrumentation
* Context propagation across services

The simplified structure allows for easy modification and observation of tracing behavior.
