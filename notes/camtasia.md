# Camtasia

* If you delete audio using audiate it deltes the corresponding video (assuming you do sync for the timeline)

   * You can restore the deleted audio but this doesn't seem to restore the video

* To see captions track click on the audio track and then in right corner where there is the option to edit in Audiate there should be an option to show the captions track
* Camtasia create should be able to remove ums and hesitations so maybe we don't need audiate just for those features

   * Looks like it includes Audiate
