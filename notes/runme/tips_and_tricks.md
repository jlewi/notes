# AutoSave

* You can use vscode file nesting to group auto save outputs together so they don't pollute the file explore
I used 

"*.md" and then {capture}-*.md


# Files not being sorted lexicographically

The output files are note beins saved in lexicographic order for example I have files with "01J4" appearing before files with O1J

# Increase the Terminal Scrollback
