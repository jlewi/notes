My open-source work has been focused on platform engineering and AI.

## ![](img_oss/foyle.jpg){width="8%"} Foyle

[Foyle](https://www.foyle.io) is a project I created to use AI to simplify deploying and operating software.

## ![](img_oss/kubeflow.jpg){width="10%"} Kubeflow

I created [Kubeflow](wwww.kubeflow.org) while I was at Google working on what is now 
[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform).
Kubeflow started as a way to build what was then Cloud ML Engine on Kubernetes by creating
a custom resource for TensorFlow Jobs. We ended up releasing that as OSS. This project morphed
into Kubeflow which we announced at [Kubecon EU in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6iMznIYwM8). 

## Hydros

[Hydros](https://github.com/jlewi/hydros) started as a project at [Primer](https://primer.ai/)
to automate hydrating Kubernetes manifests. I have continued to develop it as a way
to do continuous delivery in a declarative, level based way. I wrote a blog, 
[Data Science Meets Devops: MLOps with Jupyter, Git, & Kubernetes](https://blog.kubeflow.org/mlops/),
that describes the pattern in more detail.
